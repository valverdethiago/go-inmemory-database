# Golang in-momory database

Your task is to implement a simplified version of an in-memory database. Plan your design according to the level specifications below:

## Level 1
 The in-memory database should support basic operations to manipulate records, fields, and values within fields.

## Level 2
 The in-memory database should support querying a specific record based on a given filter.

## Level 3: 
The in-memory database should support TTL (Time-To-Live) functionality for some records.

## Level 4: 
The in-memory database should support backup and restore functionality.

## Acceptance criteria
To proceed to the next level, your solution must pass the tests defined for that level.
